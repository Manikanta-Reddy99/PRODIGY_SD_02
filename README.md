# PRODIGY_SD_02
#  Project Description:
The Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The computer provides feedback to help the player by indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the correct number. The objective is to guess the correct number in the fewest possible attempts. The project involves basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation.

# Features:
# Random Number Generation:

The program generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100) that the user needs to guess.
User Input:

Players input their guesses through the console.
# Feedback System:

The program gives immediate feedback on each guess:

"Too High" if the guess is greater than the target number.

"Too Low" if the guess is smaller than the target number.

"Correct!" if the guess matches the target number.
# Guess Counter:

The game keeps track of the number of guesses a player makes before guessing correctly.
# Option to Play Again:

After the player guesses the correct number, they are given the option to play again or exit the game.
